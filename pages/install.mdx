# Install

You can install and start IOPaint easily by following steps:

<Steps>
### Install pytorch

If you want to run model on GPU, it is necessary to install the GPU version of PyTorch. Otherwise, you can skip this step.

For NVIDIA GPU users
```bash
pip3 install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

For AMD GPU users, only works on linux, as pytorch is not yet supported on Windows with ROCm.
```bash
pip3 install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.6
```
 
### Install IOPaint
 
```bash
pip3 install iopaint
```

### Start IOPaint server

```bash
iopaint start --model=lama --device=cpu --port=8080
```

IOPaint is now running at http://localhost:8080, you can open it in your browser to start using it.

You can see all command line arguments using `iopaint start --help`, and you can see more models and features in the [models](models/) page.

    You can also use `iopaint start-web-config --config-file iopaint-config.json` to start a gradio page for configuration settings, 
    the configuration will be saved in iopaint-config.json, and then use `iopaint start --config iopaint-config.json` to start the service.
