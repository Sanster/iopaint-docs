# Memory

If CUDA OOM happens to you, in addition to reducing the size of your images, the following suggestions might be helpful:

## Erase Model

- Use `--device cpu`

## Stable Diffusion Model

- Add `--disable-nsfw-checker` and `--cpu-textencoder` to the command line
- Add `--cpu-offload`(save more GPU memory but much slower) to the command line
- Enable `Cropper` in the web user interface to only apply inpainting on part of image.
