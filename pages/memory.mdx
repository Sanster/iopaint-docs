# Memory

If CUDA OOM happens to you, in addition to reducing the size of your images, the following suggestions might be helpful:

## LaMa/LDM/ZITS/MAT/FcF/Manga

- Use `--device cpu`

## Stable Diffusion

- Add `--sd-disable-nsfw` and `--sd-cpu-textencoder` to the command line
- Add `--cpu-offload`(save more GPU memory but much slower) to the command line
  - fp16: 512x512 image needs 2GB GPU memory
  - no_half: 512x512 image needs 3GB GPU memory
- Add `--cpu-offload`(save more GPU memory but much slower) to the command line
  - fp16: 512x512 image needs 2.6GB GPU memory
  - no_half: 512x512 image needs 4.5GB GPU memory
