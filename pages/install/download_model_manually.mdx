# Download Model Manually

IOPaint will automatically download the model when the service starts. 
If you encounter any issues during the download (such as network proxy problems), 
you can manually download the model and place it in the specified directory. 
By default IOPaint will download model to `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/`, so you also need to put the model in this directory.

If you want change model dir  and add using command line arg `--model-dir=xxxx`.
