# Try IOPaint Online

## Hugging Face Spaces

You can try IOPaint at [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Sanster/iopaint-lama),
Is't running on HuggingFace's free CPU instance, so it's slow. If you want to run it on a GPU,
you can [Duplicate Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Sanster/iopaint-lama?duplicate=true) and add `--device cuda` in the [app.py](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Sanster/iopaint-lama/blob/main/app.py).
