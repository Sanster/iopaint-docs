# File Manager

For users who need to process lots of photos, File Manager would be helpful. Users can browse images in
the input/output directory, search images by name, and sort images by create time or file name.
To enable the File Manager, set two command line args when starting IOPaint.

- `--input`: A directory contains images you want to edit
- `--output-dir`: The directory where you want to save the resulting image when clicking the download button on the web page,
  the resulting image will download to the output directory. **A folder will be created in this directory to store the thumbnails**
- `--mask-dir`: Store the mask images you prepared in advance, and note that the white area is the target area.

A folder icon will appear on the left-top corner, click this icon to open FileManager, or use shortcut `f`.
