PowerPaint introduces the concept of "learnable task prompts" to guide the model in achieving specific tasks more effectively. 
These tasks include `text-guided`, `shape-guided`, `object-remove`, and `outpainting`.

In IOPaint, you can select specific tasks through the dropdown menu on the right. 
The outpainting task is automatically utilized when using Expander.

### text-guided
During the training of PowerPaint, the inpainting model utilizes the bounding box of the object as the mask for inpainting.
